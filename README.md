Ever say to yourself, "Man, I wish I could see what this image would look like if it were split into equally sized subimages which were stacked neatly side-by-side"? Whoa! Who hasn't!? Thank god, for Panelizomaticizer! It turns dreams into reality. 

Wait, What? -- Why!? 
------     

I wanted one of them fancy 'art's that has one image split across several canvases. Those are cool looking. However, I don't know what 'art' I wanted, so I began pulling stuff off the web and manually splitting it into panels in Photoshop. This quickly became boring. So, like all smart people, I spent several hours writing and debugging a program to automate the process of something which would have taken me a fraction of the time to just do by hand. 

Features: 
--------  

- Pretty solid name
- Splits images into n number of panels
- sticks those panels side-by-side
- Applies a drop shadow, because drop shadows make things look fancy
